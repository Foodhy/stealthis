## Animated Tab Bar

A tab navigation component with a **sliding active indicator** that smoothly follows the selected tab. The indicator position and width are driven by real DOM measurements, so it works with any tab label length.

### How it works

1. On click, JS reads the active tab's `offsetLeft` and `offsetWidth`
2. CSS custom properties `--indicator-left` and `--indicator-width` are updated on the tab bar element
3. The indicator `<span>` transitions to the new position via `transition: left 0.3s ease, width 0.3s ease`
4. Tab panels fade in with a short opacity transition

### Variants

- Swap `border-bottom` indicator for a filled `background` pill by changing the indicator CSS
- Add `overflow-x: auto` to the tab list for scrollable tabs on mobile

### When to use it

- Settings pages
- Dashboard sections
- Content category filters
