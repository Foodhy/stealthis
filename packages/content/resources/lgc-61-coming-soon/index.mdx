## Coming Soon + Waitlist

A minimal launch page designed around a single conversion goal: capture email addresses before launch. Features an animated countdown, email form with validation, and a drifting canvas particle background.

### Sections

1. **Logo / Brand mark** — top-left wordmark
2. **Headline** — bold hook ("Something big is coming")
3. **Countdown** — DD:HH:MM:SS live timer
4. **Waitlist form** — email input + submit, success state
5. **Social links** — minimal icon row
6. **Canvas bg** — drifting dot particles

### Features

- Countdown to a configurable target date
- Email form with inline validation feedback
- Success state swaps form for a confirmation message
- CSS-only particle animation alternative for reduced-motion
- Dark and light variant via CSS custom property
