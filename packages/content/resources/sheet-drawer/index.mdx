## Sheet / Drawer

A set of slide-in sheet panels that animate in from any of the four screen edges. Built with pure CSS transforms and vanilla JS — no dependencies.

### Variants

- **Bottom sheet** — mobile-first, drag-to-dismiss with touch and mouse
- **Right drawer** — sidebar pattern, slides in from the right
- **Left drawer** — navigation drawer, slides in from the left
- **Top drawer** — notification or search bar, slides down from top

### How it works

1. Each drawer is `position: fixed` and starts off-screen via `transform: translateY/translateX(100% / -100%)`
2. Adding the `.open` class transitions it to `transform: none`
3. A translucent backdrop sits behind the active drawer; clicking it closes the drawer
4. The bottom sheet supports drag-to-dismiss: tracking `touchstart`/`mousemove` delta and dismissing if dragged past 40% of its height
5. Pressing `Escape` closes the active drawer

### Accessibility

- Drawer panels use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`
- Focus is trapped inside the open drawer
- Close button always present and keyboard-reachable
