## Clip-path Reveal on Scroll

Elements that wipe into view using `clip-path` animated by GSAP `ScrollTrigger`. Supports multiple wipe directions — left, right, top, bottom — and a diagonal reveal variant.

### How it works

`clip-path: inset()` defines a rectangular clip mask with four inset values (top, right, bottom, left). Animating one value from `100%` to `0%` creates the wipe:

```js
// Wipe from left
gsap.fromTo(el,
  { clipPath: "inset(0 100% 0 0)" },
  { clipPath: "inset(0 0% 0 0)",
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    scrollTrigger: { trigger: el, start: "top 80%", end: "top 30%", scrub: 1 }
  }
);
```

### Variants included

- **Wipe left** — content sweeps in from the right
- **Wipe up** — content rises from the bottom
- **Diagonal** — `polygon()` clip from corner to corner
- **Split** — two halves reveal from center outward
