## Carousel

A fully-featured content carousel with two layout modes. Built with CSS `transform: translateX` and vanilla JS — no external libraries.

### Variants

- **Single-item** — one slide fills the viewport, with prev/next arrows, dot indicators, and auto-play
- **Multi-card** — three cards visible at once, scrolling one at a time

### How it works

1. `.carousel-track` is a flex row; the track translates on the X axis to reveal slides
2. `goTo(index)` calculates the correct `translateX` offset and applies a CSS transition
3. Auto-play uses `setInterval`; hovering the carousel pauses it and restores on `mouseleave`
4. Touch swipe is detected via `touchstart`/`touchend` delta — a swipe of >50px triggers prev/next
5. Dots sync with the current index; clicking a dot jumps directly to that slide

### Keyboard

- Left/Right arrow keys navigate slides when the carousel has focus
- Auto-play pauses on focus-within for accessibility
