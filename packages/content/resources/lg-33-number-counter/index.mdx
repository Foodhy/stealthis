## Smooth Number Counter

Stat numbers that animate from zero to their target value as they scroll into the viewport. Uses GSAP's `ScrollTrigger` for the trigger and `gsap.to()` with a proxy object for smooth eased interpolation.

### How it works

Each counter element stores its target in a `data-target` attribute. GSAP animates a plain object `{ val: 0 }` to `{ val: target }` and updates the DOM in `onUpdate`:

```js
gsap.to(obj, {
  val: target,
  duration: 2,
  ease: "power2.out",
  onUpdate: () => el.textContent = Math.round(obj.val).toLocaleString(),
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: el, start: "top 85%" }
});
```

### Features

- `toLocaleString()` formats large numbers with commas (1,000+)
- Suffix support via `data-suffix` (%, K, +, ms…)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` — skips to final value instantly
