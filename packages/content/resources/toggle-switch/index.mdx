## iOS-style Toggle Switch

A polished toggle switch that mirrors the iOS `UISwitch` aesthetic, built entirely with CSS — no JavaScript required. Uses a hidden `<input type="checkbox">` and a styled `<label>` for full native semantics and accessibility.

### How it works

The actual `<input type="checkbox">` is visually hidden but focusable. The `<label>` renders the track and thumb using `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. The `:checked` state drives color and thumb position via CSS transitions.

### States

- **Off** — grey track, thumb on the left
- **On** — accent-colored track, thumb slides right with `cubic-bezier` spring feel
- **Disabled** — reduced opacity, `cursor: not-allowed`
- **Focus-visible** — accessible focus ring

### Customization

Change `--toggle-color` CSS variable to recolor the active state instantly.

### When to use it

- Settings panels
- Feature flags and preferences
- Dark mode toggles
