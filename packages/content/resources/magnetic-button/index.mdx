## Magnetic Button

A button that physically reacts to the cursor — it magnetically pulls toward the mouse when nearby and snaps back smoothly when the cursor leaves.

### How it works

1. On `mousemove`, calculate the distance between the cursor and the button center
2. If within the magnetic radius, interpolate the button position toward the cursor
3. Apply the offset as a CSS `translate` transform
4. On `mouseleave`, animate back to `translate(0, 0)` with CSS transition

### Tuning the effect

- **`STRENGTH`**: How strong the pull is (`0.3` = subtle, `0.6` = strong)
- **`RADIUS`**: Distance in px at which the effect activates
- **Transition duration**: Controls snap-back speed

### When to use it

- Primary CTA buttons on hero sections
- Icon buttons in navigation
- Any interactive element you want to feel "alive"
