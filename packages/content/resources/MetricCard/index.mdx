## Metric Cards

**Metric cards** for dashboards and landing pages: label, big number with count-up animation, optional suffix, trend chip (positive/negative/neutral), and a subtle hover lift with stronger shadow.

### How it works

- **Data attributes** — Each card uses `data-value` and `data-suffix`; script reads them and animates the `.value` span from 0 to the target with an ease-out curve via `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Chips** — `.metric-chip` with classes `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` for color and semantics.
- **Hover** — CSS `transform: translateY(-10px) scale(1.01)` and a larger `box-shadow` on hover.

### When to use it

- SaaS dashboards and analytics blocks
- Landing pages highlighting KPIs or stats
- Any grid of key numbers that should feel interactive and readable
