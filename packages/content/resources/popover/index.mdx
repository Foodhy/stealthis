## Popover

Non-modal floating panels anchored to a trigger element — richer than a tooltip.

### Placements

`top` · `bottom` · `left` · `right`

Each placement has a CSS arrow pointer via `::before` border trick.

### Features

- Toggle on trigger click
- Close via built-in × button, outside click, or `Escape`
- Rich content: title + body + optional actions
- Smooth fade-in transition
