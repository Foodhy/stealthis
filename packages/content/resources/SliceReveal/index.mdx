## Slice Reveal Cards

Cards that **shatter into vertical slices** and then reassemble into the next scene. Each card is split into multiple columns; GSAP animates them up/down with slight rotation to create a dynamic “slice” transition.

### How it works

- **Dynamic slices** — JavaScript builds `slicesPerCard` slices per card, each with a background position offset so the full image reconstructs across columns.
- **GSAP timeline** — On each interval, the next card’s slices rise from below while the current card’s slices exit upward, with stagger and rotation for extra motion.
- **Progress bar** — A thin bar at the bottom reflects the time until the next slice transition.

### When to use it

- Editorial or portfolio sections where you want a distinctive card transition
- Hero galleries with strong photography
- Any card carousel where a “broken into slices” reveal fits the visual style
