## Mouse Trail Particles

A Canvas 2D particle system that spawns glowing particles at the cursor position. Each particle drifts, shrinks, and fades out — leaving a luminous comet-like trail.

### How it works

1. `mousemove` pushes new `Particle` objects into an array with position, velocity, size, opacity, and a hue
2. `requestAnimationFrame` loop updates each particle: drift by velocity, reduce size and opacity
3. Dead particles (opacity ≤ 0) are removed from the array
4. The canvas is cleared with a semi-transparent fill each frame — creates the fade trail

```js
ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"; // semi-clear → trail persists briefly
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, W, H);
```

### Performance

- Particles are plain objects — no DOM, no CSS, no reflows
- Array `.splice()` removes dead particles in-place
- `devicePixelRatio` scaling for sharp rendering on HiDPI screens
