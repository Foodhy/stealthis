## Modal Dialog

A fully accessible modal dialog system with focus trapping and scroll locking.

### Variants

- **Default** — title, body, Cancel + Confirm actions
- **Large** — wider modal with a form inside
- **Alert/Destructive** — warning icon, red confirm button
- **Fullscreen** — takes the full viewport on mobile

### Accessibility

- Focus is trapped inside the open modal
- `Escape` closes the modal
- Backdrop click closes (configurable)
- `body` scroll is locked when modal is open
- Uses `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`
