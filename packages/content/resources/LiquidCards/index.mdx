## Liquid Cards (Gel Flow)

Auto-rotating **image cards** with a “liquid” feel: the current card fades out with blur while the next scales in; the active card gets an overlay of animated blurred blobs for a gel-like effect.

### How it works

- **Card transition** — GSAP timeline blurs and fades out the current card and scales in the next.
- **Liquid mask** — Each card has a `.liquid-mask` with several `.blob` divs; on reveal, blobs are positioned randomly and animated (scale, opacity, then drift) for a soft, organic overlay.
- **Interval meter** — A progress bar reflects the time until the next transition.

### When to use it

- Hero or feature carousels where you want a softer, more editorial look
- Campaign or brand sections that benefit from a “fluid” visual language
- Any image carousel where a subtle overlay animation adds polish
