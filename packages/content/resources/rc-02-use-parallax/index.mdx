## useParallax Hook

A lightweight scroll-based parallax hook. Attach it to any element and it will move at a different speed than the page scroll, creating a sense of depth.

### Usage

```tsx
const { ref, style } = useParallax(0.3);

<div ref={ref} style={style}>
  Parallax layer
</div>
```

### Options

| Param | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `speed` | `0.3` | Parallax multiplier. Positive = slower than scroll (depth), negative = opposite direction |

### How it works

On every `scroll` event, the hook calculates how far the element's center is from the viewport center, then multiplies that by `speed` to produce a `translateY` offset. The result is applied as an inline style.

Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — returns `translateY(0)` when the user opts out.
