## Flip Card 3D

A pure CSS 3D flip card with a front and back face. Hover (or focus) triggers a smooth `rotateY(180deg)` that reveals the back face — no JavaScript needed.

### How it works

Three CSS properties work together:

1. `perspective: 1000px` on the container — creates the 3D depth
2. `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the card — keeps children in 3D space
3. `backface-visibility: hidden` on both faces — hides the back of each face when rotated

On hover, the card flips with `transform: rotateY(180deg)`. The back face starts pre-rotated at `rotateY(180deg)`, so it appears correct after the flip.

### Variants

- **Vertical flip** — change `rotateY` to `rotateX`
- **Click to flip** — add a JS toggle class instead of `:hover`
- **Different sizes** — controlled by width/height on `.card`

### When to use it

- Team member cards (name / bio)
- Product cards (image / details)
- Flashcards / quiz UI
