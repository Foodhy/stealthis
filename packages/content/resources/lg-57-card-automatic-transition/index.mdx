## Card Automatic Transition

An animated card stack component that automatically cycles through cards with smooth transitions. Each card slides, blurs, and reveals the next scene with a diagonal wipe effect, creating a cinematic scrolling experience.

### How it works

The component uses `requestAnimationFrame` to create a continuous animation loop that cycles through cards automatically. Each card's visual state is calculated based on its distance from the active card:

1. **Opacity** — fades in/out based on proximity
2. **Transform** — slides horizontally and scales for depth
3. **Blur** — applies blur filter for focus effect
4. **Clip-path** — creates diagonal wipe reveal animation
5. **Z-index** — manages stacking order dynamically

The animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and adjusts timing accordingly.
