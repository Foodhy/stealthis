## Resizable Panels

Draggable split-panel layouts with horizontal and vertical orientations, min/max size constraints, and double-click collapse. Three demos show common IDE-style and dashboard layouts.

### Variants

- **Horizontal two-panel** — left sidebar | main content
- **Vertical two-panel** — top pane | bottom pane
- **Three-panel** — left | center | right

### How it works

1. Panels use `display: flex` with `flex-basis` as the sizing unit
2. `mousedown` / `touchstart` on a resize handle begins tracking pointer position
3. `mousemove` / `touchmove` updates the adjacent panels' `flex-basis` values in real time
4. A minimum size of 80px is enforced on each panel; the max is the container width minus the opposing minimum
5. `mouseup` / `touchend` ends the drag and fires a `resize` event on the container

### Collapse / expand

Double-clicking a handle collapses the left (or top) panel to 0px and saves the previous size. A second double-click restores it. Collapsed panels show a thin strip that remains draggable.
