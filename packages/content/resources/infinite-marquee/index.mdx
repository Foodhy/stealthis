## Infinite Marquee / Ticker

A performant infinite scrolling ticker using CSS `@keyframes` and `translateX`. Content items are duplicated in the DOM to create a seamless loop — no JavaScript animation loop required.

### How it works

The marquee track holds two identical sets of items side by side. The animation translates the track by `-50%` (one full copy width), then loops. Since both copies are identical, the transition is seamless.

```
[ A B C D E ] [ A B C D E ]
←── translateX(-50%) ───────
```

### Features

- **Pause on hover** — `animation-play-state: paused`
- **Reverse direction** — add `.marquee--reverse` class for RTL scroll
- **Speed control** — `--marquee-duration` CSS variable
- **Gap control** — `--marquee-gap` CSS variable
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

### When to use it

- Logo / partner strips
- Live news or status tickers
- Announcement banners
