## Ciber Portfolio

A cyberpunk-inspired portfolio website featuring a neon city grid background rendered in Three.js. The site includes scroll-velocity reactive effects, animated ticker, scan lines, and immersive cyberpunk aesthetics with neon cyan, pink, yellow, and purple color schemes.

### How it works

The portfolio combines cyberpunk design with advanced web technologies:

1. **Three.js Neon City** — 3D city grid with neon-lit buildings and particles
2. **Scroll Velocity Tracking** — Lenis tracks scroll velocity to drive animations
3. **Reactive Effects** — Scan lines and ticker speed react to scroll velocity
4. **Neon Aesthetics** — Cyberpunk color palette with neon accents
5. **Motion Systems** — GSAP animations for smooth transitions

### Key features

- Three.js neon city background with 3D buildings
- Scroll-velocity reactive animations
- Animated ticker that speeds up with scroll
- Scan line effects synced to scroll
- Cyberpunk neon color scheme
- Noise texture overlay for authentic feel
- Smooth scroll with Lenis
- GSAP-powered animations

### Technical details

The Three.js scene includes:
- Procedurally generated city blocks with neon emissive materials
- Particle system for atmospheric effects
- Grid helper for depth perception
- Dynamic lighting with neon colors
- Scroll-velocity driven rotation and movement
