## Stagger Fade-in on Scroll

A grid of cards that stagger-animate into view as they enter the viewport. Uses `ScrollTrigger.batch()` — the most performant way to stagger multiple elements without creating one ScrollTrigger per element.

### How it works

`ScrollTrigger.batch()` collects elements that enter the viewport within the same animation frame and fires a single `onEnter` callback with all of them at once:

```js
ScrollTrigger.batch(".card", {
  onEnter: (batch) =>
    gsap.from(batch, {
      opacity: 0, y: 40,
      stagger: 0.1,
      duration: 0.6,
      ease: "power2.out"
    }),
  start: "top 88%"
});
```

### Why batch() over individual ScrollTriggers

- One RAF call handles all elements entering together
- Prevents the "wave" effect when many elements enter simultaneously
- Significantly less memory and CPU overhead on large grids
