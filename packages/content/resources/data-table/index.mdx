## Data Table

A feature-rich data table built entirely with vanilla JS and CSS. Handles 15+ rows with sorting, filtering, selection, column visibility, and pagination.

### Features

- **Sort** — click any column header to cycle asc → desc → none; sort indicator arrow updates
- **Search** — real-time filter across Name and Email columns; resets to page 1
- **Row selection** — individual checkboxes + select-all header checkbox; indeterminate state when partial
- **Bulk actions** — bar appears above table when rows are selected, shows count with Delete and Export buttons
- **Column visibility** — dropdown lets you hide/show any column; persists across re-renders
- **Pagination** — 10 rows per page; prev/next buttons + numbered page buttons; ellipsis for long page lists

### How it works

1. A `DATA` array holds all 15 user objects; `filteredData` is recomputed on search or sort
2. `render()` slices `filteredData` for the current page and rebuilds the `<tbody>` rows
3. Column sort state is stored as `{ col, dir }` — `dir` cycles through `asc → desc → null`
4. Selected row IDs are stored in a `Set`; the select-all checkbox reads the intersection with the current page
5. Column visibility is a plain object keyed by column id; hidden columns are `display: none` for both `<th>` and all corresponding `<td>`
