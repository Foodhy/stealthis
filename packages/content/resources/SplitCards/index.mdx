## Split Slide Cards

**Split cards** carousel: each card’s image is split into left and right halves; on transition the current halves slide outward (e.g. `xPercent: -120` / `120`) while the next card’s halves slide in from the sides, driven by GSAP.

### How it works

- **Structure** — Each card has `.half.left` and `.half.right` with `data-image`; script sets `backgroundImage` and GSAP animates `xPercent` for the slide.
- **Timeline** — Next card starts with halves off-screen (`xPercent: -100` / `100`); current halves go to `-120` / `120` while next halves go to `0` in the same timeline.
- **Interval meter** — Progress bar indicates time until the next transition.

### When to use it

- Hero or feature carousels where a strong horizontal split fits the layout
- Portfolios or campaigns that benefit from a “reveal” feel
- Any image carousel where you want a clear left/right motion instead of fade or diagonal
