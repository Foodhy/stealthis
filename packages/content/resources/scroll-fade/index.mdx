## Scroll Fade In

A lightweight scroll-triggered fade-in animation using the native **Intersection Observer API** — no libraries required.

### How it works

Elements start invisible (`opacity: 0`, slightly translated down) and fade in once they enter the viewport. The observer disconnects after the element is visible, keeping things performant.

### When to use it

- Hero sections with staggered content
- Blog post cards loading as you scroll
- Feature grids on landing pages

### Tech used

- `IntersectionObserver` — native browser API, zero dependencies
- CSS transitions — smooth, GPU-accelerated

### Accessibility

Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by skipping the animation for users who prefer it.
