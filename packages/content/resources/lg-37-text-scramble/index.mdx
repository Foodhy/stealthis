## Text Scramble / Matrix Decode

The classic hacker-movie text effect — characters scramble through a random pool before each letter resolves to its final value. Zero dependencies, pure vanilla JS with `requestAnimationFrame`.

### How it works

A `TextScramble` class maintains a queue of characters to resolve. Each frame:

1. For each character position, if it hasn't resolved yet, pick a random char from the `chars` pool
2. Once a character's frame counter reaches its threshold, lock it to the final value
3. Build the full string from resolved + scrambling characters and set `el.innerHTML`

```js
chars = "!<>-_\\/[]{}—=+*^?#________";
```

The `________` padding biases toward blank space — slowing visible scrambling near the end for a natural feel.

### Trigger modes

- Auto-plays on load
- Hover to re-trigger
- Cycles through multiple phrases with a delay
