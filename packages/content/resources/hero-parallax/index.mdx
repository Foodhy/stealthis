## Hero Parallax

A multi-layer parallax hero that creates a sense of depth by moving background layers at different speeds relative to scroll position.

### How it works

Each layer has a `data-speed` attribute controlling how fast it moves relative to the scroll:
- `0.0` — fixed (doesn't move)
- `0.5` — moves at half scroll speed
- `1.0` — moves at full scroll speed (standard)

On scroll, `requestAnimationFrame` reads `window.scrollY` and applies `translateY` to each layer.

### Performance tips

- Use `will-change: transform` to hint GPU compositing
- Keep layers to 3–4 max to avoid overdraw
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` (not `scroll` event directly) for smooth 60fps

### Accessibility

Wrap with `prefers-reduced-motion` check to disable parallax for users who prefer it.
