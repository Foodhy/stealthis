## Context Menu

A right-click context menu with nested sub-menus, icon support, dividers, destructive items, and full keyboard navigation. No dependencies.

### Features

- Opens at cursor position, clamped to viewport bounds
- Nested sub-menu opens on hover or right-arrow key, closes on left-arrow
- Disabled items are non-interactive
- Destructive (Delete) item styled in red
- Closes on outside click, left-click elsewhere, or `Escape`

### How it works

1. `contextmenu` event is intercepted on the demo area; `preventDefault()` suppresses the browser menu
2. The menu is positioned with `position: fixed` at `event.clientX / clientY`, then clamped so it never overflows the viewport
3. Sub-menus use `position: absolute` relative to their parent item, opening to the right
4. Keyboard: `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` move focus between items; `ArrowRight` opens a sub-menu; `ArrowLeft` closes it; `Enter` activates the focused item

### Accessibility

- Menu uses `role="menu"`, items use `role="menuitem"`
- Disabled items carry `aria-disabled="true"`
- Sub-menu trigger items have `aria-haspopup="true"` and `aria-expanded`
