## Lenis + GSAP Scroll Cards

A **scroll-driven** card experience: Lenis provides smooth scrolling while GSAP ScrollTrigger pins a stack of cards and animates each one out (fade, lift, rotate) as you scroll, then brings the next into focus.

### How it works

- **Lenis** — smooth scroll; its `raf()` runs each frame and `lenis.on("scroll", ScrollTrigger.update)` keeps ScrollTrigger in sync.
- **ScrollTrigger** — pins the `.pin` container and uses a long scroll distance to drive a single timeline; each card animates out and the remaining stack repositions.
- **Initial stack** — cards are offset by `y`, `rotate`, `scale`, and `opacity`/`brightness` for depth.

### When to use it

- Editorial or narrative scroll sections
- Product or portfolio highlights that should feel cinematic
- Any page where scroll progress should drive card transitions instead of time
