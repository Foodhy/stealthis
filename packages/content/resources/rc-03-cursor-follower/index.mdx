## Cursor Follower

A fully self-contained custom cursor component. Hides the native cursor and renders a dot + trailing ring using `requestAnimationFrame` with lerp smoothing.

### Usage

```tsx
// Mount once at the app root — it renders its own fixed-position elements
<CursorFollower />
```

### Props

| Prop | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dotSize` | `8` | Diameter of the center dot in px |
| `ringSize` | `40` | Diameter of the outer ring in px |
| `ringLerp` | `0.1` | Ring follow speed (0 = no movement, 1 = instant) |
| `color` | `"#38bdf8"` | Accent color for both dot and ring |

### How it works

1. `mousemove` updates a ref holding the raw cursor position (no re-render)
2. A `requestAnimationFrame` loop lerps the ring position toward the cursor each frame
3. Both elements are rendered as fixed-position `div`s with `pointer-events: none`
4. The native cursor is hidden via `cursor: none` on `body`

Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — falls back to the native cursor when opted out.
