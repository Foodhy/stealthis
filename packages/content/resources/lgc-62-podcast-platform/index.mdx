## Podcast Platform

A landing page for a podcast show or network — the editorial aesthetic of a magazine with the dark familiarity of a streaming platform.

### Sections

1. **Hero** — Show name, tagline, latest episode featured card, play button
2. **Player bar** — Sticky bottom audio player (progress, play/pause, time, volume mock)
3. **Episodes** — Card grid with episode number, title, duration, category tag
4. **Categories** — Filter pills that animate the grid
5. **Host** — Bio section with photo, quote, social links
6. **Subscribe** — Platform icons (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc.) + newsletter

### Key UI elements

- **Audio player** — functional progress scrubbing mock with waveform visualizer
- **Episode cards** — hover reveals a "play" overlay
- **Category filter** — JS-driven show/hide with count badge
- Lenis smooth scroll + GSAP stagger on episode grid reveal
