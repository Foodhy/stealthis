## Glow Metric Card

A single-card component for KPIs and dashboards. The glow is created with a radial gradient + blur so it feels premium without heavy shadows.

### When to use

- SaaS dashboards with a primary metric
- Hero sections that need a stat highlight
- Pricing pages with a featured number

### Notes

- The glow lives in a `::before` layer to keep the content crisp.
- Use `line-height: 1` on the value to avoid vertical jitter.
