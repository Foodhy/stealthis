## Glassmorphism Card

A modern **glassmorphism** card component using `backdrop-filter: blur()` for a frosted-glass appearance, combined with semi-transparent backgrounds and soft borders.

### How it works

The effect relies on three CSS properties working together:

1. `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` — blurs content behind the card
2. `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` — semi-transparent background
3. `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` — subtle light border

### Browser support

`backdrop-filter` is supported in all modern browsers. For Firefox, prefix with `-webkit-backdrop-filter` for older versions.

### When to use it

- Feature cards on dark/gradient backgrounds
- Modal dialogs over blurred content
- Navigation panels with transparent feel
