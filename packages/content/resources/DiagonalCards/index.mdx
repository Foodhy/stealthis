## Diagonal Wipe Cards

A **diagonal wipe** card carousel where each image slides across a clipped mask, creating a sharp, editorial transition between scenes.

### How it works

- **GSAP timelines** control the incoming and outgoing cards with `clip-path` polygons.
- **Diagonal mask**: Each card uses a full-bleed background inside a `.wipe` element whose clip-path animates from a narrow edge to full frame.
- **Interval meter**: A progress bar at the bottom shows the timing between transitions.

### When to use it

- Storytelling sections with bold photography
- Portfolio hero strips that cycle through featured shots
- Any layout where you want a stylized diagonal wipe instead of a simple crossfade
