## Minimal Typographic Portfolio

A portfolio where the hero has no images — just a massive kinetic headline that morphs between roles. Work is listed as text, with an image that follows the cursor on hover.

### Sections

1. **Nav** — Name left, availability badge right ("Available for work")
2. **Hero** — Massive display type, animated role switcher, scroll indicator
3. **Selected Work** — List view: index number, project name, category, year. Hover shows floating image preview.
4. **About** — Single paragraph, tight and confident
5. **Skills** — Inline tag cloud, monospaced
6. **Contact** — "Let's work together" + email

### Key interactions

- **Role switcher** — GSAP `TextPlugin` cycles through "Designer / Developer / Creative Director"
- **Work list hover** — image floats and follows the cursor via `mousemove`
- **Character-by-character** hero reveal on load
- Lenis smooth scroll with scroll-progress bar at top
