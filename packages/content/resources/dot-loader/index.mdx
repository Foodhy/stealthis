## CSS Dot Loader

A minimal three-dot bouncing loader built entirely with CSS `@keyframes` — zero JavaScript, zero SVG, zero dependencies.

### How it works

Three `<span>` elements share the same `bounce` keyframe animation, each with a staggered `animation-delay`. The animation scales each dot from normal to slightly enlarged and back, creating a wave effect.

### Variants

- Change `animation-timing-function` to `ease-in-out` for a softer bounce
- Swap `scaleY` for `translateY` for a vertical bounce
- Adjust `animation-duration` for faster/slower rhythm

### When to use it

- Button loading state (inline)
- Full-page loading overlay
- List item placeholder while data fetches
