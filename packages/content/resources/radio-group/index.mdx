## Radio Group

Mutually exclusive selection controls — choose one from a set.

### Variants

- **Basic** — classic radio button with label (one column)
- **Card** — full card is clickable; selected card highlights with accent border
- **Button group** — pill-style segmented control (looks like a toggle)

All variants use real `<input type="radio">` inputs hidden visually but accessible to screen readers and keyboards.
