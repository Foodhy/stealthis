## Toast Notification Stack

A zero-dependency toast notification system with four semantic variants: **success**, **error**, **warning**, and **info**. Toasts slide in from the bottom-right, stack vertically, and auto-dismiss after 4 seconds.

### How it works

1. `showToast(message, type)` creates a `<div>` with the right variant class and appends it to a fixed container
2. A CSS `slide-in` keyframe animates entry; a `slide-out` class triggers exit before removal
3. Auto-dismiss uses `setTimeout` — clicking the × button cancels the timer and dismisses immediately
4. Toasts stack naturally via flexbox `column-reverse`

### Variants

- `success` — green accent, checkmark icon
- `error` — red accent, X icon
- `warning` — amber accent, triangle icon
- `info` — blue accent, info icon

### When to use it

- Form submission feedback
- Async operation results (save, delete, upload)
- System alerts and status updates
