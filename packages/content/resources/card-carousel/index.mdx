## Card Carousel

An auto-advancing **card carousel** where each image card animates through depth, tilt, and brightness changes, driven by a GSAP timeline and a visual interval meter.

### How it works

- **Stacked layout**: Cards are absolutely positioned and layered with `z-index`, scale, and vertical offset to create depth.
- **GSAP timeline**: Each interval animates the active card out and the next card in, then relays out the whole stack.
- **Progress meter**: A simple bar animates from `0%` to `100%` over the interval duration so users can feel the timing.

### When to use it

- Hero sections with cinematic image rotations
- Highlighting destinations, case studies, or featured content
- Any layout where you want a single focal card that changes over time
