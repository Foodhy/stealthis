## Liquid Gradient + Three.js

An immersive portfolio website featuring dynamic liquid gradient backgrounds created with Three.js and custom shaders. The background responds to mouse movement, creating interactive liquid-like effects that flow and morph in real-time.

### How it works

The portfolio combines advanced WebGL techniques with modern web design:

1. **Three.js Shader Material** — Custom fragment shader creates liquid gradient effects
2. **Touch Texture System** — Tracks mouse/touch movement and creates ripple effects
3. **Dynamic Color Schemes** — Five preset color schemes (Solar, Deep Sea, Citrus, Sunset, Nebula)
4. **Custom Cursor** — Animated cursor that responds to interactive elements
5. **Real-time Updates** — Continuous animation loop updates gradients based on time and interaction

### Key features

- Three.js WebGL background with custom shaders
- Interactive liquid gradient effects
- Mouse/touch tracking with ripple effects
- Five dynamic color scheme presets
- Custom animated cursor
- Glassmorphism UI elements
- Responsive design
- Performance optimized with RAF

### Technical details

The shader uses:
- Noise functions for organic movement
- Wave and swirl calculations for fluid motion
- Touch texture sampling for interactive ripples
- Color mixing for smooth gradient transitions
- Luma calculations for visual depth

### When to use it

- Creative portfolio websites
- Immersive brand experiences
- Interactive landing pages
- Design studio showcases
- Premium product presentations
- WebGL-powered interfaces
