## Transition Card

A scroll-triggered card component that creates smooth transitions between cards as you scroll. Each card fades, blurs, and scales based on its position relative to the viewport, creating a cinematic scrolling experience.

### How it works

The component uses scroll position calculations to determine each card's visual state:

1. **Scroll Progress** — Calculates progress through the scroll area
2. **Distance Calculation** — Determines each card's distance from the active position
3. **Visual Effects** — Applies opacity, blur, scale, and translateY based on distance
4. **Smooth Transitions** — Uses CSS transitions for smooth visual changes
5. **Performance** — Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for optimized updates
