## Startup Pitch Deck

A scrolljack pitch deck format — each "slide" snaps and pins as the user scrolls, following the classic investor narrative arc: **Problem → Solution → Product → Traction → Team → CTA**.

### Structure

1. **Hero** — Big hook statement, raise amount badge
2. **Problem** — The pain point, stat callouts
3. **Solution** — Product description, key differentiator
4. **Traction** — Animated metrics (ARR, users, retention)
5. **Team** — Founder cards
6. **CTA** — Schedule a call / deck download

### How it works

- `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` on the container for native CSS snap
- GSAP `ScrollTrigger` with `pin: true` for animated transitions within each slide
- Lenis smooth scroll coordinates with the snap behavior
- Stat counters animate on slide enter via `IntersectionObserver`

### When to use it

- Pre-seed / seed fundraising pages
- Product Hunt launches
- Demo Day landing pages
