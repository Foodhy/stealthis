## SVG Path Drawing

SVG paths that draw themselves as the user scrolls, using the classic `stroke-dashoffset` technique — driven by GSAP `ScrollTrigger` scrubbing.

### How it works

1. Measure each path's total length with `path.getTotalLength()`
2. Set `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` both to that length (path fully hidden)
3. Animate `stroke-dashoffset` to `0` — path appears to draw itself

```js
const len = path.getTotalLength();
gsap.set(path, { strokeDasharray: len, strokeDashoffset: len });
gsap.to(path, {
  strokeDashoffset: 0,
  ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: { trigger: svg, scrub: 1 }
});
```

### Why `scrub: 1`

Ties the animation progress directly to scroll position — the path draws forward and backward as the user scrolls up and down. The `1` adds a 1-second lag for a smoothing feel.

### When to use it

- Decorative connecting lines between sections
- Illustrated process/flow diagrams that reveal on scroll
- Logo draw-on animations
